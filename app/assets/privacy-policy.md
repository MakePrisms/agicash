## 1. Introduction and Overview.

This Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) provides a comprehensive description of how MakePrisms Inc. (“MakePrisms”, “Agicash”, “We,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, and shares information about you in connection with your access to and use of the Services, not only through www.agi.cash and any applications developed by us (collectively, the “Site”) but also through any external applications where the Services are embedded or utilized. The services offered by Agicash consist of a non-custodial wallet web application that runs entirely on your device or within a secure enclave server controlled solely by your device (the “Services”). We do not operate any servers that hold your funds or execute transactions on your behalf.

By using the Services, you agree to our Terms of Use (the “Terms”) and understand that the Terms represent a binding agreement between you and us. By using the Services, you also agree to our collection, use, and disclosure practices, as well as any other activities described in this Privacy Policy.

## 2. Changes to Privacy Policy.

We reserve the right to revise and reissue this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon our posting of the revised Privacy Policy. For the avoidance of doubt, your continued use of the Services indicates your consent to the revised Privacy Policy then posted.

We also temporarily store certain transaction data required for sending and receiving payments. These temporary entities are automatically deleted within 24 hours of completion or failure.

The data described above is stored solely to support self-directed user activity. Agicash does not control, access, or transmit user funds and does not use this data to initiate or process transactions.
