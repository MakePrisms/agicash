# Agicash Privacy Notice

This Privacy Notice describes how MakePrisms Inc., a Delaware corporation, ("<strong><em>MakePrisms</em></strong>," "<strong><em>Agicash</em></strong>," "<strong><em>we</em></strong>," "<strong><em>us</em></strong>," or "<strong><em>our</em></strong>") receives, stores, uses, discloses, and otherwise processes information about you, when you access or use our self-custodial wallet web or mobile application (the "<strong><em>Service</em></strong>") either through <a href="http://www.agi.cash" target="__blank" class="underline text-blue-400">www.agi.cash</a> or the Agicash app (when made available), (collectively, the "<strong><em>Site</em></strong>"), or through any external applications where the Service is embedded or utilized. We may provide different or additional notices of our privacy practices for other services or offerings that we provide, in which case, those notices will supplement or replace the disclosures in this Privacy Notice.

The Service offered by Agicash provides you with an interface for a self-custodial digital wallet ("<strong><em>Wallet</em></strong>") that allows you to store, track, and transfer "Ecash." Ecash is a bearer-style digital unit of account that is issued and recorded by participating "Mints," which are Third-Party Service Providers (defined below) that operate in accordance with the "Cashu Protocol" and that issue Ecash in exchange for bitcoin or other value. The Cashu Protocol is a set of standards governing transaction messaging and cryptography that, when operating in combination, allow users to mint, redeem, and transfer Ecash.

In addition to the Wallet and our Services involving Ecash, our Services may also provide you with the ability to access certain other products, services, materials, or content provided by third parties (each, a "<strong><em>Third-Party Service Provider</em></strong>," and such services are "<strong><em>Third-Party Services</em></strong>") from within the Site. Any Third-Party Services available from within the Site may be subject terms, conditions, and policies (including privacy policies) imposed by the Third-Party Service Provider ("<strong><em>Third-Party Service Terms</em></strong>"). Your use of any such Third-Party Services via the Site is subject to the Third-Party Service Terms and these Terms.

To support the Wallet's functionality, we operate servers that store data related to your account, operational data, and transaction metadata (collectively, "<strong>Wallet Data</strong>"). We also store transaction data encrypted with your Wallet's Private Key(s) ("<strong>Encrypted Data</strong>"). Encrypted Data is only accessible via the Site, making such Encrypted Data inaccessible to Agicash for any purpose. Agicash cannot access the Wallet's Private Keys and does not receive or hold a copy of the decryption key(s) necessary to access the Encrypted Data. Via the Site, you will have the sole power to access your Private Keys and decrypt the Encrypted Data.

Agicash may change this Privacy Notice from time to time. If Agicash makes changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this notice. If we make material changes, we will provide you with additional notice. We encourage you to review this Privacy Notice regularly to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.

## Collection of Information

To operate the Service, Agicash servers may need to store a limited amount of personal information, such as account data, operational data, and transaction metadata. Agicash may also store other transaction information as Encrypted Data, but as noted above, that is only accessible via the Site and inaccessible to Agicash for any purpose. In this section, we describe the categories of personal information that Agicash does collect and the sources of this information.

### Information that Agicash Collects Automatically

When you use the Service, we automatically collect the following information from the Site:

- <strong>Device, Usage, and Activity Information:</strong> Agicash collects information about how you access and interact with the Site and Service, including data about access dates and times and related metadata; and data about the device and network you use, such as your operating system version, browser version, application version, IP address, and other unique identifiers. Agicash collects transaction metadata (e.g., transaction direction, associated account, date and time, currency); the number (but not the value) of encrypted Ecash tokens within your wallet; and the extended public key (xpub) used to derive Cashu Protocol locking keys. Agicash collects Encrypted Data such as Ecash tokens, transaction amounts, fees, preimages, and bolt11s. Encrypted Data is inaccessible to Agicash for any purpose. Agicash also temporarily collects certain transaction data required for sending and receiving payments including send and receive quotes, send and receive swaps, and transaction identifiers. These temporary entities are automatically deleted within 24 hours of completion or failure.

- <strong>Information Collected by Cookies:</strong> Agicash uses certain functional cookies to set optional themes or color palettes for the Site. For more information about the cookies and similar tracking technologies used and the choices available to you, see the Your Choices sections below.

The data described above is stored solely to support self-directed user activity. Agicash does not control, access, or transmit user funds and does not use this data to initiate or process transactions.

### Information You Provide to Agicash

If you create an Agicash account, we will collect information directly from you, including your email address, username, wallet and Lightning Address, contacts (i.e., other Agicash users saved to your account), your default currency, certain Mint URLs, any third-party accounts tied to your Agicash wallet (e.g., Spark, Stripe, or layer two bitcoin network services), and any other information you choose to provide (e.g., email communications).

As a self-custodial wallet, if you submit or withdraw funds using the Service, you will be directed to interact directly with a Third-Party Service.

### Information Agicash Collects from Other Sources

As part of your interactions with Third-Party Services (e.g., exchanging fiat currency), you may be directed by the Service to a third-party fiat on-ramping provider (e.g., Stripe) or a Mint, to complete certain Know Your Customer ("<strong><em>KYC</em></strong>") and Anti-Money Laundering ("<strong><em>AML</em></strong>") regulatory requirements. While the Service may direct users to engage with such Third-Party Services to provide the applicable KYC and AML personal information, Agicash does not receive or have access to any KYC or AML data that you provide to them. The information you provide to such Third-Party Services is subject to their own privacy policies.

We obtain information about you from other sources. For example, we may collect information about your use of the wallet from Mints (e.g., the number (but not the value) of tokens issued to you), from service providers who help us collect certain Device, Usage, and Activity Information, and from other Agicash users when they list you as one of their contacts in their accounts.

Further, if you create or log into your account through a third-party platform (such as Google), we may also inadvertently receive other personal information about you, such as your name, profile picture, email address, and any other information the third-party platform discloses about you, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such platform.

### Information Agicash Derives About You

Agicash may derive information or draw inferences about you based on the information we collect. For example, we may make inferences about your approximate location based on your IP address or infer that you are interested in certain products or services based on your previous uses of the Service.

## Use of Information

Agicash uses the information we collect or derive about you to provide and maintain the Service, including to enable you to connect and interact with third parties (such as other Cashu Protocol users or Mints) through the Service.

We also use the information we collect to:

- Communicate with you;
- Provide, maintain, and improve the Service;
- Develop new products and services;
- Personalize your experience (e.g., color palette of the Site);
- Send you technical notices, security alerts, support messages, and other transactional or relationship messages;
- Send you marketing communications (see the Your Choices section below for information about how to opt-out of these communications at any time);
- Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with the Service;
- Detect, investigate, respond to, and help protect against security incidents and other malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, and help protect the rights and property of Agicash and others;
- Comply with legal and financial obligations; and
- Create de-identified and aggregate data that cannot reasonably be linked to you.
