# Mint Risks

Agicash requires adding a third-party ecash Mint. Mints issue ecash tokens and are responsible for providing custody, validation, issuance, redemption, valuation and authentication. Before you add a Mint, make sure you are aware of the risks associated with the specific Mint. 

Agicash makes no representations, warranties, or guarantees about any Mintâ€™s integrity, legality, liquidity, or functionality. Your relationship with any Mint, including the issuance, redemption, or valuation of ecash, is solely a matter between you and that Mint.
