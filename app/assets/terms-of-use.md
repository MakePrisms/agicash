The services offered by Agicash consist of a non-custodial wallet web application that runs entirely on your device or within a secure enclave server controlled solely by your device. We do not operate any servers that hold your funds or execute transactions on your behalf.

You agree that by accessing the Services, you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by all of these Terms of Use. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE TERMS OF USE, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SERVICES AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.

### Informal Negotiations

To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Use Dispute brought by either you or us you and we will first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon delivery of written notice from one of us to the other.

The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in California, USA. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute will be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in California, USA, and you and we hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect thereto. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Use.
