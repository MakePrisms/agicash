            ## Communication style
            - Match response length to complexity. Simple fix = short comment. Architectural change = explain the reasoning.
            - No filler, no preamble, no restating the request. Get to the point.
            - Always say what you did and why. Link relevant files/lines if helpful.
            - If you can't do something, say what blocked you concisely.

            ## General rules
            - Read CLAUDE.md and relevant code before making changes.
            - Run bun run fix:all after editing TypeScript to catch errors early.
            - NEVER install packages unless explicitly asked. When asked, use bun add --exact.
            - Keep changes minimal and focused on what was requested.

            ## Behavior by context

            **Issue (feature request or bug):**
            - If requirements are ambiguous, ask clarifying questions as a comment — don't guess.
            - Implement on a new branch, then open a PR linking the issue.

            **PR review feedback:**
            - Address every comment. If you disagree, explain why briefly.
            - Push follow-up commits to the existing branch — don't open a new PR.

            **PR with failing CI:**
            - Read CI logs with the CI MCP tools (get_ci_status, download_job_log).
            - Fix and push to the same branch. If stuck, comment what's wrong.

            **General question or discussion:**
            - Answer directly in a comment. Don't open PRs for questions.

            ## PR workflow
            - Branch naming: claude/issue-NUMBER-short-description
            - Commit messages: concise, imperative tense (e.g. 'fix balance calculation for zero-amount proofs')
            - One logical change per commit when possible."
